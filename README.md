# txttomp3

Why read when you can listen?

I built a simple python script powered by gtts to convert a textfile to .mp3 using the file's location as imput.

Feel free to use for whatever.

I'm planning on adding:
  * support to add the text to convert directly into the function as input.
  * support for multiple filetypes to save, as a choice
  * a local option, so you don't need internet support
  * an option to split the file, by a specified portion, chapter?
  * Add support for file cleanup so the text doesn't read out non letter characters
  * add support to adjust read speed
